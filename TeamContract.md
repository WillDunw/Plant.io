# Team Contract

### Definition of “good enough” for this project

*What would the team collectively consider “good enough” of an achievement for the project?*

Good enough for us means that it meets the requirements proposed by the project owner and does not crash. Whatever we do has to be working properly. Is visually appealing.

### Division of work

### Frequency of communication

*How often will the team be in touch and what tools will be used to communicate?*

We will have a discord groupchat. We do not plan to have any rigid rules set for communication, however we trust that we will communicate when necessary.

### Response delays

*What is a reasonable delay to reply to messages? Is it the same for weekdays and weekends?*

Maximum of one day no reply. Not expecting fast replies late at night.

### Receiving feedback

*How do you prefer to receive feedback?*

- William: Do better.
- Griffin: I don't like that you did x, next time can you do y.
- Carlos: This is kinda bad. Improve it asap.

### In case of conflict

*If a team member fails to communicate as described in this contract or does not respond to constructive feedback, what measures should the other teammate take?*

Have a mediator in case of a conflict. In case of a teammate failing to communicate, write down what they were supposed to do. If the case is really bad, contact a teacher.
